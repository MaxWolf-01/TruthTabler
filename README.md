Visualizations of circuits made possible by [Lelleck](https://github.com/Lelleck). <br/>
Can solve any boolean expression and create CCNF(POS), CDNF(SOP) and minimize it using the Quine-McCluskey Method.
Minimization for expressions with 7 variables and beyond may take some time (and memory), since it has exponential complexity.<br />
Also converts boolean expressions to only use NAND or NOR gates and can draw them. <br />
